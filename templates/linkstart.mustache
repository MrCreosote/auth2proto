Hi {{user}}!<br/>

{{#hasprov}}
You can link an account to your KBase account with:<br/>
{{/hasprov}}

{{#providers}}
<p><a href="{{urlpre}}{{name}}"><img src="{{img}}" alt="{{name}}"/></a></p> 
{{/providers}}

{{#hasprov}}
You will be redirected to the identity provider website where you will be asked
to allow KBase to view your account information - your account ID, email
address, and name.<br/>
You will have 30 minutes to complete the identity provider's login process.

Sorry, linking accounts is currently disabled.
